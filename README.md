# Python Challenge

Inside of each folder (PyBank and PyPoll) there is:

* A file called main.py which is the script to run for each analysis.
* A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files I used.
* An "analysis" folder that contains the text file that has the results from my analysis.

# PYBANK
Created a Python script for analysing financial records. I was given set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

My python script analyses the records to calculate each of the following:
* total number of months included in the dataset
* net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

 My final script is able print the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
 
# PYPOLL
I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. I created a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following:


* total number of votes cast
* a complete list of candidates who received votes
* percentage of votes each candidate won
* total number of votes each candidate won
* winner of the election based on popular vote
